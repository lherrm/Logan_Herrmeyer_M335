# Case Study 2: Data and Data Questions

## Question 1: What factors influence voting patterns in the United States?

This question interests me because elections seem to have a lot of factors influencing them. For example, demographics, population density, history, and changing ideologies of political parties throughout history all seem to influence it. I would like to see which factors are the most important. I am also interested in seeing what would influence individual voters, and voters in a county or state together.

My cutie Sophie thinks this is an interesting question that makes sense and that I could answer in a semester.

A historian named Allan Lichtman created 13 keys, written in his book "The Keys to the White House" to follow to predict each presidential race. These keys have accurately predicted each presidentatial race, inlcuding 2020, since the year 1984. According to Lichtman's system, when 8 or more of the keys are positive, the incumbent party is predicted to win.

A study by Justin Klos explored how suburbs in Philadelphia were becoming more liberal, and suburbs in Pittsburgh are becoming more conservative. In this study, he did statistical analysis of spatial and demographic features to try to determine the cause of these changing voting patterns.

I can find datasets for both population data from the US census, and voting data in multiple elections on the website Kaggle. It is easy to download, and I would need to download multiple files.

## Question 2: How has air travel changed throughout the pandemic?

This question interests me because airlines have been hit especially hard by the pandemic, and have had to adapt. Airlines at the beginning of the pandemic had sharp declines in passengers, and the number of people traveling has been increasing since. I think it is interesting to find out which airlines have "won" or "lost" during this pandemic, and why they did so. Did one airline overtake another as the largest? Are number of passengers related to COVID outbreaks in each country?

My wife said that this is a question that makes sense and is possible to answer this semester, but is not really interesting.

An article titled "The COVID-19 pandemic and airline cash flow" by B. Vinod explores what airlines should do to increase their cash flow during the pandemic, but does not delve deep into how it has affected airlines.

Another study named "The stock price reaction of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline, hotel, and tourism industries" looked at the stock price of airlines and other travel related buisnesses during the pandemic. The authors concluded that companies with large cash reserves, and high market to book (total value of stock vs total value of assets) ratios were less impacted by the crash. They also concluded that investors valued cash reserves when investing in a company, especially for hotel companies. The study also concluded that companies in the travel industry with high leverage (i.e. debt) were more impacted by the pandemic. The researchers used multi-variate regression to come to these conclusions.

One more article titled "How COVID-19 is impacting and reshaping the airline industry" discusses how and which airlines were affected the most during the pandemic.

I am in general able to find data for this topic. Stock prices and earnings are public data and are easy to find for airline companies (however often in text format which is difficult to work with), and COVID data for countries is also widely available. Data for the number of travelers in the US throughout the pandemic is available from the TSA. Data for domestic and international flights is available in CSV format from the US DOT. The website https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ contains much of this information, such as market share.

## Question 3: How does geography impact the wealth and influence of countries?

This question interests me because geography has always been a topic I have been interested in, and it seems like it can impact the destiny of countries greatly. For example, Italy, being in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, was able to spread out its power and form the Roman Empire. America, being seperated from Eurasia by two large oceans, was able to avoid the most severe damage during both World Wars.

My wife thinks this question is interesting and makes sense, but is a bit too broad.

An article titled "The Geography of Poverty and Wealth" in the 2001 issue of Scientific American discusses this topic. It brings up the Scottish economist Adam Smith, who wrote "The Wealth of Nations". He said coastal regions tend to be wealthier than inland areas because of easier access to trade. The authors of the article also bring up that tropical countries tend to be poorer because of disease and lower agricultural productivity, compared to temperate countries. A map shows that the poorest countries by GNP per capita lay between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Generally countries in the temperate zone, according to the article, are high or middle income. Even within a country, such as Brazil, the temperate parts (in the south) are richer than the tropical parts. Using mapping software, the researchers found that global wealth is highly concentrated in the temperate zones near coasts, with 52.9% of world GNP. In contrast, tropical regions far from coasts only had a GNP per capita 33% of the world average. Finally, the authors concluded three main reasons geography affects wealth: Access to trade, disease, and agricultural productivity.

Data such as GDP and GDP per capita can be found from the IMF, the World Bank, and the CIA, and they can all be downloaded in CSV format. A dataset of country borders and coastlines is available from the World Bank also. Climate data, is again available from the World Bank. It seems like all of this data is widely available.
