* Functions should be used instead of copy pasting because they are easier to read and update
* You should use a function if you copy paste something more than twice
* Comments and function names are important
* Conditional code can be done with if-else statements
* If you want a pipeable function, its important to think of the return value and type.
* Transform functions transform the data, while side effect functions perform an action on the object (these should just return the first argument)
* R will look in the environment outside the function if a variable is not definited inside a function.
